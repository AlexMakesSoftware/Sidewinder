Ship spinner  - A Javascript three.js learning exercise.
Draws a simple faux-bbc graphic of an old Elite game ship model.

Elite was a computer game for the BBC Micro in the 80's and was a truely increadable work of software engineering. Squeezing every last bit of functionality from a mere 32k - with about 6 bytes to spare. Written by Ian Bell and David Braben.

Many thanks to Marc Moxon who took the time to make www.bbcelite.com, where I found all the ship date I needed to recreate this model: https://www.bbcelite.com/cassette/main/variable/ship_sidewinder.html. 

## getting started with the code:
```
npm install

npx vite

```
Starts the vite development server and a build tool.

## To build the distribution (for hosting, say on github pages)
```
npx vite build
```

## Demo
To see it working live, go to: https://alexmakessoftware.github.io/Sidewinder/

Note to self: there's a seperate git repo in the dist folder, cd into that and commit it to update the online github pages demo.
